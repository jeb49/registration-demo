This is the registration demo for my church's event, the color fun run. 

This project serves two purposes:

1) To allow multiple people to register at once.

2) To prevent people from registering without paying.

Since this is an annnual event, the website will not be live year round. If it is not live, then the code and demo will be accessible from here:

https://web.njit.edu/~jeb49/demo/demo.html *

Otherwise it will be here:

https://colorfunruneb.com/page5.html

*the payment pages lead to actual paypal payment pages, for testing purposes
