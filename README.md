# registration-demo

This is a registration demo for my Church's charity event, the Color Fun Run that registers a person for the event that was written in PHP, HTML and Javascript. The live version of the event will be here https://colorfunruneb.com/page5.html, otherwise, the demo version will be here: https://web.njit.edu/~jeb49/registration-demo/demo.html
